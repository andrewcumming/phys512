# PHYS 512 Computational Physics with Applications: Winter 2023 Course outline

## Description and goals

A course in computational methods in physics. Computing is important in all aspects of modern physics, whether it be solving non-linear equations for a theoretical calculation or analyzing and modelling data sets in an experiment. By taking this course, you will 

- become familiar with a range of computational techniques that can be applied to physics problems, and know how to get started on tackling a problem numerically.

- understand the essential ideas underlying standard computational methods, and become familiar with their implementation in Python, in particular in the NumPy and SciPy libraries.

- gain experience in solving a range of different physics problems numerically.

There are no prerequisites, but some previous experience in Python writing basic programs and plotting data etc. is recommended (for example, as seen in Physics lab courses at McGill).

## Instructor and TAs

Prof. [Andrew Cumming](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming/), andrew.cumming@mcgill.ca, Rutherford 310.

The TAs are Valentin Boettcher, Simon Guichandut, and Matthew Lundy.


## Time and place

Class will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1-2.30pm in Rutherford 115.

The first class is Thursday August 31st and the final class is on Tuesday Dec 5th. There is no class on Tuesday October 10 (Reading break) or Thursday November 30 (makeup day with a Monday schedule). 

The **debug den** will be held on Mondays between 10am and noon in the Piano room (Rutherford 211). This will be an informal session where you can ask the TAs questions and work together on class exercises and homeworks.


## List of topics

A preliminary list of topics is given below [The ordering of topics may change, and we may not cover all of the subtopics, depending on time available.]

- *Computing basics.* Getting set up. NumPy and SciPy libraries. Github. Matplotlib. Programming best practices. Floating point arithmetic, roundoff error. Speed of computation.

These topics will be illustrated with a range of different physics applications, such as simulating the propagation of electromagnetic waves in plasmas, numerical solutions of the Schrodinger equation, thermal instabilities and non-linear oscillators, fitting gravitational wave data, and other examples.


## Useful books and other resources

There is no required textbook for the course, but an excellent Python-based book available through the McGill library is 

- [Numerical Methods in Physics with Python](https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/search/detail/1162187759?queryString=ti%3A%28numerical%20methods%20physics%29&databaseList=283%2C638&origPageViewName=pages%2Fadvanced-search-page&clusterResults=&groupVariantRecords=&expandSearch=true&translateSearch=false&queryTranslationLanguage=&lang=en&scope=wz%3A12129) by Alex Gezerlis (the link is to the McGill library ebook)

Other books you could look at are:

- [Computational Physics](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/) by Mark Newman. Also an excellent Python-based book. It is only available in paper format from the library, but I've linked to the book website which has some sample chapters that you can look at.
- [An Introduction to Computational Physics](https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/search/detail/63814390?queryString=tao%20pang%20computational&expandSearch=true&translateSearch=false&databaseList=283%2C638&clusterResults=true&groupVariantRecords=false) by Tao Pang (the link is to the McGill library ebook). Excellent coverage of the topics in this course, with code samples in Fortran/Java.
- [Computational Physics](https://www.physics.purdue.edu/~hisao/book/) by Giordano and Nakanishi. An interesting book that is organized by physics topic rather than numerical method.
- [Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing](http://numerical.recipes/book.html) by Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling and Flannery. The classic book on numerical methods with really good explanations. The downside is that the C/Fortran code comes with a very restrictive license. Available to read online (although with annoying popups unless you purchase a license).
- [Introductory Computational Physics](https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/search/detail/569384322?queryString=au%3A%28klein%20godunov%29&databaseList=283%2C638&origPageViewName=pages%2Fadvanced-search-page&clusterResults=&groupVariantRecords=&expandSearch=true&translateSearch=false&queryTranslationLanguage=&lang=en&scope=wz%3A12129) by Klein and Godunov has a nice concise treatment of different topics. 

There are also other courses on computational physics that have materials online:

- [Mike Zingale's class AST 390: Computational Astrophysics at Stonybrook](https://zingale.github.io/computational_astrophysics/intro.html)

- [Computational Physics tutorials at the University of Toronto](https://computation.physics.utoronto.ca)

- [Course materials for PHY407 at UofT](https://github.com/PHY407-UofT)



## Assessment and Course Format

This will be an interactive class, with a mixture of lecture and problem solving during class time. *There will be coding exercises in class -- you should bring your laptop to class with you.*

There will also be a weekly "*Debug den*", which will be an informal hackspace where you can work together and get help from the TAs. If there are topics you would like covered in a tutorial in these sessions, you can let the TAs know. 

Your grade will be based on 

- Homeworks (30%), given out every 1-2 weeks during the term. The lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the final grade. Note that you can discuss homework questions with other students in the course, but you should write your own homework solutions and any code you hand in should be your own.
 
- Project (30%). In teams of 2-3 students, the project component will involve developing a code to investigate a physics problem of interest to the student. The topic must be decided on and approved by the instructor by early October, and the project will be due at the end of term. For more information and suggestions for topics, see the [Project instructions](https://andrewcumming.github.io/phys512/project_instructions.html).

- Take-home final exam (40%). A mixture of analytic and computational problems. The take-home exam will be available for a 72 hour period and designed to be completed in 3 hours.

We will use the following distribution and communication tools:
- Lecture notes and assignments will be made available through this website
- Homework and project submissions will be through each students private Github repository
- Grades will be distributed in myCourses
- A Slack workspace is available for the class for students to collaborate on projects and to ask questions or discuss the homework. Note that discussions and questions about homework **must** be posted to the `#homework` channel (we will make a tool available to post questions anonymously if you prefer to do that). *Note that the TAs will not answer questions about homework via direct message in Slack, you must use the homework channel.*

The homework will be graded according to the following rubric:

0. No meaningful attempt made at a solution (no code, unrelated code, non-functional code whose function is hard to determine).
1. Part of an answer provided / a plan or idea for a solution is discernible. Partly functional code that can be understood and forms the beginnings of a solution. 
2. An understanding of the problem and a concrete idea for an answer / code implementation is present. Code is almost functional and understandable, but does not fully solve the problem. Alternatively, there is a complete working code but the code is hard to understand (poor style or commenting).
3. Demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem and it's solution. Working *clear* code, or non-working code with a clear explanation of what the problem with it may be.
